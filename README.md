# To Start Out

Run this workflow form GitPod: https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/tdahlstrom/gitpod-workflow-test

Bwb auto-starts with Docker, please wait until Bwb starts before attempting to open Bwb.  This will take about a minute.  Once the terminal stops scrolling during the Docker install, click on the _Ports_ tab above the terminal window which is right next to the _Terminal_ tab.  You should see a table with the following headers _Port_, _Address_, and _State_.  There should be an entry in the table.  At the end of the _Address_ column for the only entry, click on the globe icon, and this will open Bwb in a new browser tab.


# Helpful Notes
**Resize Bwb Window** - To auto resize the Bwb window in the browser, this will require editing the url in the address bar.  If you're working on a workflow with changes, save the changes first as resizing will cause Bwb to reset.  The current url should be something like this _http://example_address/vnc.html?autoconnect=1_, edit the address to _http://example_address/?auto_ and press the enter key.  After a few seconds Bwb will reload at the current size of your browser window.

**Delete GitPod Instance** - To delete a GitPod instance, got to this [LINK](https://gitpod.io/workspaces).  You will see a list of your most immediately opened GitPod instances.  Click the options button, it is 3 black dots stacked on top of each other, which will be to the right of a GitPod instance.  Click on the red _Delete_ text that is displayed in the drop-down when clicking on the 3 black dots.  You will be prompted with a new window, click the red button that says _Delete Workspace_.
